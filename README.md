**Proposal**
Your proposal should answer Heilmeier's questions (all 9 of them; see list below); if you think a question is not very relevant, briefly explain why. In other words, your proposal should describe what you plan to do (the problem to address), why you want to do it, how you will do it (what tools? e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, Hadoop, Kinect, iPad, etc.), how your approach is better than the state of the art, why it may succeed, and when it does, what differences will it make, how you will measure success, how long it's gonna take, etc.

9 Heilmeier questions (source)

1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.


2. How is it done today; what are the limits of current practice?


3. What's new in your approach? Why will it be successful?


4. Who cares?

5. If you're successful, what difference and impact will it make, and how do you measure them (e.g., via user studies, experiments, ground truth data, etc.)?


6. What are the risks and payoffs?


7. How much will it cost?


8. How long will it take?


9. What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success? How will progress be measured?
Your proposal document must be no more than 2 letter-size pages long, excluding references. In other words, only the references do NOT count towards the page limit; everything else — including the literature survey — counts. Use at least 1-inch margin for each page (top, right, bottom, left).  It must use 11pt font (or larger). The document must be in PDF format. You may create the document using any software that you want; we highly recommend using LaTeX (see below for example LaTeX template). Include any figures, charts, tables, captions, etc. whenever useful — they count towards the page limit (they may include text whose font size is smaller than 11pt, but such text must be legible). Your document should be self-contained. For example, do not just say: "We plan to implement Smith's Foo-Tree data structure [Smith86], and we will study its performance." Instead, you should briefly review the key ideas in the references, and describe clearly the alternatives that you will be examining.
